# Relational Database Investigation & Visualization 📊🛢️

As part of my **Data science** learning, I investigated a **relational database**, writing and executing **SQL queries** to extract key insights. I utilized **data visualization tools** to present query results, making **data patterns and trends** more understandable.  

This project strengthened my ability to work with **databases** effectively and present **data-driven findings**.

## Features 🚀
- **SQL Queries:** Extracted valuable insights from the database.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Used **joins, subqueries, and data cleaning**.
- **Data Visualization:** Transformed raw data into understandable insights.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identified key trends within the data.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **SQL** (Joins, Subqueries, Data Cleaning)
- **Data Visualization Tools**
- **Relational Databases** (PostgreSQL)

## How to Reproduce 🏃‍♂️
1. Set up a **SQL database** and import the dataset.
2. Run SQL queries to **extract insights**.
3. Use a **data visualization tool** to present findings.
4. Interpret and analyze **key patterns and trends**.
